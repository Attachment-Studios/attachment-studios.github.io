                <h3>Thinks</h3>
                <p>I <b>love</b> <b>coding</b> a lot, and it is my <b>passion</b> as well but maybe other than <b>music</b> I am really <b>multitalented</b>.
                    The second thing is that I also love <b>drawing</b> or <b>basically</b> <b>arts</b>, though <b>never thought of any career plans for arts</b>.
                    I am also a <b>YouTuber</b> though <b>not that famous</b> but <b>like every second YouTuber I was also inspired by someone</b>. Or <b>maybe not</b> because <b>I didn't watched much coders' devlogs</b>...
                    However, I know who are <b>my favourite coders</b>, although they <b>might or might not be famous or proffesionals</b>. Maybe <b>I like thier style of making videos or something</b>?
                    Who knows though. But yeah, <b>technically</b> <b>I made this website</b> and I am even <b>satisfied</b> from <b>what I conquered</b>!
