### Thinks

I'm a **good thinker** with the will to convert my dreams, emotions, expressions, thoughts and all other stuff going inside my brain into code that can execute it and make it true. With **no limit to imagination**, I can create apps and games I wish to. Although I might get multiple and frequent errors in a specific project, but that gives me more experience. I express and feel the **positive side** of me and the environment around me.
